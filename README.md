# MinnaSync
MinnaSync is a anime streaming platform that allows you to watch anime together with anyone and everyone.

### Why "MinnaSync"?
"min'na (みんな)", is the informal way to *say* "everyone" or "all of you" in Japanese. This specific variation was chosen *because* it is informal.

### Features
- In-sync video playback. If you pause, play, or seek, everyone else's video will be in sync with it.
- Chatting with others in the same room.
- Searching and queuing anime to playback.
- ... more to come!
